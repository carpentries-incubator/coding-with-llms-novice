:::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Entering a prompt to generate code

Enter into your LLM:

```
We want to write a python script that loads file
data.csv into a variable for further analysis.
```
::: hint

Your output may differ from the output for other people.

:::

::: solution 

## Example Output
 
```output
import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame 
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv") 

# Now 'data' holds your dataset with column names from the first row 
print(data.head())   
```
:::

## Challenge 2: what is the code you got doing?

- which packages does it use?
- which data type is used?


## Challenge 3: Refine the prompt to ensure package pandas is used

::: solution

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

* interact with an AI to generate code to use for their data analysis
* Read to understand code generated by their [prompt](link to glossary)  
* interact with an AI to get explanations
