Some thoughts from the final discussion session in the course:

- data analysis narrative vs. more "normal" program-to-*do*-some-stuff narrative
  - data analysis -> validation as high-level activity that cannot be possibly outsourced: 
    statistics offer lots of possiblities to "numerically successfully" calculate numbers, 
    which are nevertheless not the correct answer to the data analysis question. 
    (Note: Claudia has examples showing this depending on subtle details of the data analysis task; 
    related pairs of tasks that lead to different calculations)
  - "normal coding tasks" tend to have errors that lead to exceptions; 
    though errors in program logic are possible here as well.
  - "normal coding task" errors with AI-agents: program logic mistake may lead to wrong file getting deleted etc.
=> think over again what is a good narrative for the course
  
- balance:
  - ability to read code to detect bugs (in the extreme requiring super-human concentration)
  - ability to formulate (here: ask for) good unit tests = high level ability
